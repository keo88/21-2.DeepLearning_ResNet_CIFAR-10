# 21-2.DeepLearning_ResNet_CIFAR-10

Personal Implementation of deep neural network.
XOR and MNIST models were implemented without deep learning libraries such as Tensorflow, pytorch, etc.
(backpropagation and forward operation implemented)

ResNet is built with pytorch.(CIFAR-10 Image Classification Example)
