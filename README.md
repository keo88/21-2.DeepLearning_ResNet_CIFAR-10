# 21-2.DeepLearning_ResNet_CIFAR-10

Personal Implementation of deep neural network.
XOR and MNIST models were implemented without the use of popular deep learning libraries such as Tensorflow, pytorch, etc. (All it requires is Numpy)

ResNet is built with pytorch.(CIFAR-10 Image Classification Example)
